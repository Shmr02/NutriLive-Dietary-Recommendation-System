# NutriLive-Dietary-Recommendation-System

NutriLive is a machine learning-based dietary recommendation system designed to help users select food categories aligned with their health goals. The system employs K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to model and recommend suitable food categories based on input parameters such as food weight, nutrient amount, and other encoded attributes.

ðŸ“‚ Project Overview NutriLive is developed under the theme of NeuroVision, a company focused on promoting healthier lifestyles. This project aims to assist individuals in making informed dietary choices by leveraging machine learning techniques.

ðŸ§  Features Food Category Recommendations: Suggests food categories based on user-input features. Machine Learning Approach: Utilizes the KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, Decision Tree Model to get the best for classification and prediction. Nutrient-Based Modeling: Analyzes food weight and nutrient content to provide recommendations.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used Programming Language: Python Libraries: scikit-learn (for machine learning) pandas (for data manipulation) numpy (for numerical computations) matplotlib & seaborn (for visualization) Dataset: A custom dataset containing details about food items and their nutritional information.

ðŸš€ How It Works Input Features: Users input features such as food weight and nutrient content. KNN Algorithm: The system predicts the most suitable food category based on the input using the KNN model. Recommendations: The system suggests a food category that aligns with the user's dietary needs.

This project was a group effort as part of our Machine Learning assignment. I would like to extend my gratitude to my teammates â€” Danish Aiman, Basharil Aiman, Shamir and Miza Syazwana â€” for their hard work and dedication throughout the process. A special thanks to our beloved lecturer, Dr Azuana Binti Ramli, for their guidance and feedback, which helped us bring NutriLive to life. This experience has been both educational and rewarding, giving us the opportunity to apply machine learning to a meaningful problem.
